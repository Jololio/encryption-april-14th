The Colonial Pipeline Ransomware attack (April 29th, 2021):

The hacking group known as DarkSide, initiated a Ransomware attack on the billing infrastructure of the Colonial Pipeline company. It didn't actually target the physical operation of the pipeline itself, just the billing infrastructure. Their motivations were that they wanted $5,000,000 worth of bitcoin (which was 3x more than Colonial's annual profits at that time) and that if they WEREN'T paid they would initiate more cyberattacks. The company was forced to hault the flow of gasoline, causing a shortage in the midwest, southeast, and northeast regions of the United States and caused a semi-mild panic to spread throughout.

One of the most MAJOR tech flaws that was revealed, was that the Colonial Pipeline company didn't use multi-factor authentication. Because of this, they were able to breach the company through a VPN account that wasn't being used at the time, but still had access to the network, with a single compromised password. Authorities don't know HOW they obtained those credentials in the first place, some theorize an insider leaked it to them, others say it was a part of several other Colonial accounts that had been leaked in a batch on the darknet, but we don't know for sure.

Since then, the company had gone through and sweeped all deactivated accounts that were no longer in use, and a cybersecurity firm called Mandiant began setting up detectors in the system to detect if any other attacks came in (which is common after a major breach like this), as well as adopting and implementing multi-factor authentication. They also tried to see how deep the hackers were able to go, specifically how close they were to the operational technology systems, the systems that actually control the flow of gasoline, and even though they got through MOST of Colonial's network, evidence suggests they never breached the operational systems.
